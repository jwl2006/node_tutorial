it is the first time the bomb, called a GBU-43, has ever been used in combat.
The GBU-43 is one of the largest airdropped munitions in the 
U.S. militaryâ€™s inventory and was almost used during the opening salvos of 
the Iraq War in 2003. By comparison, U.S. aircraft commonly drop bombs
 that weigh between 250 to 2,000 pounds.
